# CosinessIndex
This is my first year group project on IOT in EMJMD Programme (GENIAL). Implemented a full-stack (administrator and end-users) IoT project, that is capable of sensing (temperature, humidity, CO2, CO, light, sound), analyzing (Belief Rule-Based Expert System) and delivering a multi-level cosiness index.
